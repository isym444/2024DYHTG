INTRODUCTION
Stockopolis is a game where you have to build a city and survive as long as possible.
There are different types of buildings you can choose, which have different consequences for your world.
Appartments bring in people, who pay taxes, increasing your city's money.
Oil drills and wind turbines bring in oil and energy respectively, which can in turn be used to power your world (each building has ongoing operating costs) or sold for profit.

Investment banks can also be used to gain money for further construction projects.
Investment banks are randomly assigned an investment risk tolerance (conservative, risky or "yolo"), which determines their profit/loss at each unit time based on normal distributions (different mean and standard deviation parameters as well as skew). 
Depending on the number of banks and their average risk-taking, market volatility dynamically updates over time. This in turn affects commodity prices. Keep an eye on these to time the optimal moment to sell any resources for the highest profit.

Build too many polluting buildings however and your world's health suffers resulting in people dying. If your popultion or world health reaches 0, the game is over.
Counteract this buy using renewable energy resources or building forests.
